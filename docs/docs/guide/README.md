# What is Baygon?

**Baygon** is a minimalistic test framework for any types of executables. It provides a simple way of testing code with a [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) or a [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) description of tests.

It is mainly designed for simple tests in academic environments, but it can be used for any kind of tests.

Points can be assigned to tests, group of tests or automatically distributed based on the number of tests. The total earned points can be used to calculate the final assignment grade.

::: warning
Baygon is currently in `beta` stage. It's ready to be used for building functional tests, but the config and API are not stable enough, which is likely to have breaking changes between minor releases.

## How it works

Baygon is a CLI tool that runs tests described in a JSON or YAML file. It can be used to test any kind of executable, including binaries, scripts, and even web applications. It's designed to be used for student assignments.

Based on the description file, a `TestSuite` is built. A `TestSuite` is a collection of `TestCases` that are executed sequentially. Each `TestCase` is a collection of `TestSteps` that are executed sequentially.

By default Baygon will run all the tests in the description file.

## What a strange name!

Baygon is a brand of insecticide popularized in the 80s by the commercial ads featuring Michel Leeb. The name was chosen because it's a simple and short name that is easy to remember. And Baygon is meant to kill bugs in your code!

## Get started

Let's say you have a C program you want to test:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    if (argc > 1 && strcmp(argv[1], "--version") == 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Version 0.1.1\n");
        return 0;
    }
    if (argc != 2 + 1) return 1;
    printf("%d", atoi(argv[1]) + atoi(argv[2]));
}
```

You then need to write a test file that can be named `t.yaml`, `t.json`, `test.yaml`, `test.json`, `tests.yml` or `test.json`. Baygon is gonna find it. Inside this file you describe each individual functional test:

```yaml
version: 1
tests:
  - name: Arguments check
    tests:
      - name: No errors if two arguments
        args: [1, 2]
        exit: 0
      - name: Error if less than two arguments
        args: [1]
        exit: 1
  - name: Stdout is the sum of arguments
    args: [1, 2]
    stdout: []
  - name: Version on stderr
    args: ['--version']
    stderr:
      - regex: '\b\d\.\d\.\d\b'
      - contains: 'Version'
```

To be able to run the tests, simply install [Baygon](https://pypi.org/project/baygon/):

```
pip install baygon
```

Then build and test you application:

```
$ cc app.c -o a.out
$ baygon -v ./a.out
Test 1: Arguments check
  Test 1.1: No errors if two arguments.......... PASSED
  Test 1.2: Error if less than two arguments.... PASSED
Test 2: Stdout is the sum of arguments.......... PASSED
Test 3: Version on stderr....................... PASSED

Ran 4 tests in 0.01s.

ok.
```

::: tip
You may need to use `pip3` instead of `pip` depending on your system.

## Options

Baygon has a few options to help you run your tests:

```
Usage: baygon [OPTIONS] [EXECUTABLE]

  Baygon functional test runner.

Options:
  --version                 Shows version
  -v, --verbose             Shows more details
  -l, --limit INTEGER       Limit errors to N
  -d, --debug               Debug mode
  -r, --report PATH         Report file
  -t, --table               Summary table
  -f, --format [json|yaml]  Report format
  -t, --config PATH         Choose config file (.yml or .json)
  --help                    Show this message and exit.
```
### Verbose

The `-v` or `--verbose` is cumulative. The more you use it, the more details you get, you can use it such as `-vvv`.

0. Only minimum output will be displayed (default value)
1. Display all tests
2. Display all tests and steps
3. Display all tests, steps and output
